# ZigZaGUI
ZigZaGUI is a personal project made to make FFmpeg more amateure friendly and automatic. A simple web based panel show current transcoding progress, while a backend php script executes FFmpeg with the choosen settings, and run through the tasks one by one.

I'm by no means a professional programmer so you will most likely find problems with my code.
Plese do not expose this to the public internet!
