# ZigZaGUI
ZigZaGUI is a personal project made to make FFmpeg more amateure friendly and automatic. A simple web based panel show current transcoding progress, while a backend php script executes FFmpeg with the choosen settings, and run through the tasks one by one.

I'm by no means a professional programmer so you will most likely find problems with my code.
You should not expose ZigZaGUI to public internet.

# Installing
I have an installation guide available at my website https://khps.no/en/zigzagui/docs/index.html
